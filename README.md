Built from the angular-express-seed project, this is my home-page that I use to shamelessly plug things I can do.  Not that it's super-awesome...just mildly awesome.  It is also a show-case for AngularJS running against a Node.js server w/ stuff like Server-Sent-Events and web-sockets thrown in for good fun.
